### A fun game with a Sneaky Bunny
This is another one of those coding algorithms that never get used anywhere but then it's great for your creativity.
<hr>

### The Problem :
- There are 100 holes in farm numbered 0 - 99.
- A rabbit is randomly placed in a hole.
- You are to guess the number of the hole the rabbit was put in 10 tries - (Kinda impossible tho).
- The rabbit moves to an adjacent hole after every wrong guess.
- It cannot stay inside the same hole after a wrong guess.
- eg: if the rabbit was in hole 5, after a wrong guess it can only move to hole 4 or 6.

### The Solution :
You can guess all the numbers you want in 10 tries (can be tweaked to whatever you like) buts it's very unlikely to guess where this sketchy bunny will be.
I have written an algorithm to corner the rabbit but it still need's some work.

### The Bug :
The algorithm I have written to catch this sneaky bunny kind of works, it sometimes misses the bunny and it has to be run again or maybe a third before it can catch the rabbit.
Let's say probability of success is about 40%.

### Resolution :
I'm looking forward to someone who can collaborate or help me solve this problem or at the very least make the code better.
